Preheat oven to 350˚F with racks in the center of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with butter and dust with flour, tapping out the excess.

Stir then sift together 2 1/2 cups flour, 2 Tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt.

In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat together 1/2 cup softened butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar for a few minutes until sugar is moistened and the mixture looks powdery like snow.

Mix in two eggs, adding them one a time, and beating well to incorporate between each addition. Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract until blended.

With the mixer on, gradually add 3/4 cup oil and mix on medium speed until well incorporated.

Stir 1 tsp vinegar into your buttermilk then mix it into the batter on medium speed until incorporated.
Add flour mixture all at once and mix on medium speed just until well blended and no streaks of flour remain, scraping down the bowl as needed.

Add 1/2 tsp gel red food coloring or add it to reach desired color and mix just until blended, scraping down the bowl as needed.
Divide evenly between prepared pans and bake at 350˚F for 30 minutes. Let rest in cake pans for 20 minutes then invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely to room temp before assembling with Cream Cheese Frosting.
